<h2>Logistic Regression</h2>
<p>Logistic regression is a statistical method used for modeling the probability of a binary outcome, meaning it predicts the probability that an instance belongs to a particular category.</p>

<h2>Types of Logistic Regression</h2>
<p>On the basis of the categories, Logistic Regression can be classified into three types:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Binomial:</strong> In binomial Logistic regression, there can be only two possible types of the dependent variables, such as 0 or 1, Pass or Fail, etc.</li>
    <li><strong>Multinomial:</strong> In multinomial Logistic regression, there can be 3 or more possible unordered types of the dependent variable, such as “cat”, “dogs”, or “sheep”</li>
    <li><strong>Ordinal:</strong> In ordinal Logistic regression, there can be 3 or more possible ordered types of dependent variables, such as “low”, “Medium”, or “High”.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Applications of Logistic Regression:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Binary Classification: Used for problems like spam detection or pass/fail outcomes.</li>
    <li>Medical and Health Sciences: Predicts disease likelihood based on risk factors.</li>
    <li>Marketing: Predicts customer churn in marketing scenarios.</li>
    <li>Credit Scoring: Assesses default risk on loans using financial factors.</li>
    <li>Social Sciences: Predicts outcomes like voting behavior or group participation.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Advantages of Logistic Regression:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Simple Implementation and Interpretation: Easy to understand and implement.</li>
    <li>Computational Efficiency: Efficient for large datasets.</li>
    <li>Handles Non-Linear Relationships: Can handle non-linear relationships.</li>
    <li>Probabilistic Outputs: Provides probabilities for nuanced interpretation.</li>
    <li>Works Well with Small Sample Sizes: Performs well with limited observations.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Disadvantages of Logistic Regression:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Assumption of Linearity: Assumes a linear relationship, which may not always hold.</li>
    <li>Overfitting Issues: Prone to overfitting with a large number of predictors.</li>
    <li>Sensitive to Outliers: Impactful results with the presence of outliers.</li>
    <li>Assumption of Independence: Assumes independent observations.</li>
    <li>Limited Outcome Types: Suitable only for binary outcomes.</li>
</ul>
